 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Kevin's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a curious kid, fascinated by computers and the endless possibilities they offered sparked early on by playing games and wondering how they worked. That curiosity grew into a passion for computer science, and I pursued it through my studies, learning programming, Unix, Linux, and the theory behind it all. Along the way, I taught myself Android app development with a dream of building my own app. That dream evolved as I discovered a new fascination: machine learning and AI. I dove into Python and started experimenting, building small projects and exploring the ways code could solve real-world problems. During my university years, I gained practical experience working as a software engineering intern, applying my skills in real projects and learning how to turn ideas into functioning systems. But even with all this growth, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had put aside my original dream: creating my own product. Now, I’ve realized I’ve grown comfortable again—working on projects feels easier than stepping back onto the ledge to build something from scratch. But it’s time to get uncomfortable again. It’s time to chase that original dream, the one my younger self was so excited about: building my own app, my own product. To make it happen, I’m putting measures in place now to streamline my work and focus so I can dedicate the time and energy needed to build that dream. By the end of this year, I’ll be ready to dive in fully. Don’t wait up—I’m coming.
